# ML_Semester_Project
This repo contains my semester project, "Parking Project," for the Applied Machine Learning course (Fall 2021) at Stern College for Women, Yeshiva University.

This Jupyter notebook contains a Logistic Regression which acts as a binary classifier to predict the likelihood of receiving a parking ticket in a given area. The model uses NYC's parking violation datasets from NYC OpenData.
